                                             TECHNOLOGIES USED
Frontend
HTML: For structuring the web form.

CSS: For styling the web form and ensuring responsiveness.


Backend
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for handling server-side logic.

FPDF: A Python library for generating PDF documents.

Other Tools
Git: For version control.

VS Code/PyCharm: For code development and debugging.


                                              ARCHITECTURE
The application follows a client-server architecture:

Frontend: The user interface is built using HTML and CSS, providing a responsive and interactive form for data input.

Backend: Flask handles the server-side logic, processes user input, and generates the resume using FPDF.

Database: Not used in the current version, but can be added in the future for storing user data.


                                     FLOW OF THE APPLICATION
User fills out the web form with personal, educational, and professional details.

The form data is sent to the Flask backend via a POST request.

Flask processes the data, sanitizes it, and generates a PDF resume using FPDF.

The generated PDF is sent back to the user for download.

                                    ALGORITHMS AND MODELS
Algorithm for PDF Generation
Input: User data (name, contact details, education, skills, projects, achievements, certifications).

Processing:

Sanitize input data to handle unsupported Unicode characters.

Use FPDF to create a PDF document.

Add sections (e.g., header, summary, education, skills) dynamically based on user input.

Output: A professionally formatted PDF resume.

                                        TEXT SANITIZATION
A custom algorithm is used to replace unsupported Unicode characters (e.g., en dash –, em dash —) with their closest ASCII equivalents.


                                          IMPLEMENTATION
Frontend
The frontend consists of a single HTML form (index.html) styled using CSS (styles.css).

The form is responsive and works seamlessly across devices.

Backend
The backend is implemented using Flask (app.py).

Flask handles form submission, processes user input, and generates the PDF using FPDF.

PDF Generation
The create_resume function in app.py uses FPDF to dynamically generate the resume based on user input.

                                  
                                   
                                   FEATURES
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive web form for easy data input.

Dynamic PDF Generation: Automatically generates a professionally formatted resume.

Customizable Sections: Supports personal details, education, skills, projects, achievements, and certifications.

Photo Integration: Allows users to upload a passport-sized photo.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

                                   CHALLENGES FACED
Unicode Handling: FPDF does not support all Unicode characters, so a custom text sanitization algorithm was implemented.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the web form works seamlessly across devices required careful use of CSS media queries.

File Upload: Handling file uploads (e.g., photos) required additional backend logic.


                                       FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Customizable Templates: Add support for multiple resume templates.

AI-Based Suggestions: Use NLP to suggest improvements to resume content.

Job Portal Integration: Allow users to directly apply to job postings from the application.

Database Integration: Store user data for future use.

Multilingual Support: Add support for multiple languages.


                                          CONCLUSION
ResumeBuilder is a practical and efficient solution for creating professional resumes. By leveraging modern web technologies like Flask and FPDF, the application simplifies the resume creation process and saves time for users.
